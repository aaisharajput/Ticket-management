                    A Ticket Sercice is a software used to create, organize, prioritize, and resolve customer support tickets. 
                    These tickets can be complaints or requests raised by your employees or your customers. 
                    Once a Ticket Sercice system receives an issue, it automatically converts it into a unique ticket and notifies your agents. 
                    They can either manually pick tickets or automate the entire ticket assignment process.

                    Each ticket contains relevant information pertaining to an issue, such as the customer's name, contact history, 
                    the nature of the problem, file attachments, and other details. Moreover, managers can access reports to view team 
                    performance and monitor the service experience.

                    An online ticket management system works by creating a unique ticket that records interactions pertaining to a customer issue. 
                    The ticket number is shared among your agents as well as the customer and acts as an important point of reference for both parties. 
                    Once a ticket is generated, your agents can track its progress right from the start to the point when the desired solution is shared with the customer. 
                    Now, depending on the nature and complexity of the issue, it can be prioritized, escalated, or assigned to a different department. 
                    Once the issue has been resolved, your agents can mark the ticket as 'Resolved' or 'Closed'. 
                    However, these tickets can be reopened in the ticket management system if the customer encounters a similar issue again or initiates follow-up requests.
